# Module 1 Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

This project is a sample website for a web company. The work I did involved making adjustments to the starter code, which was provided as part of an assignment for the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp. Without changing the function or appearance of the actual website, I made the HTML and CSS code more readable and consistent with the goal of improving the website's accessibility and search engine optimization. In the HTML code, I renamed the generic elements into semantic elements, edited individual lines to make the code consistent, and added a title to the page.

By working on this project, I've improved my own coding skills in several ways. First, I was able to practice the github flow enough times that, by the end, I no longer had to reference any instructional materials for how to create a branch, make changes, push the branch, and create a pull request. Second, I learned about HTML best practices and how to improve the consistency and readability of documents. I also learned new HTML semantic elements such as 'section', 'header', and 'nav'. Finally, I learned what makes html code accessible.
